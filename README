pydoc.vim integrates Python documentation system into Vim. If you use
Vim and Python, you want to use it :-)

pydoc.vim is an ftplugin and has to be installed in your ftplugin directory.
Installing it in the plugin directory wont work.

You can find the complete documentation in the code itself.

Happy hacking!
